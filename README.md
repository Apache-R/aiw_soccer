# aiw_soccer

Soccer game for AI Warehouse https://www.youtube.com/@aiwarehouse, made by the community, for the community.

You play against albert and, in case you don't know what soccer is, you try to kick the ball into the opponents goal and defend your own. In the game there's a bunch of different characters, including: Albert, Kai, [redacted], and more. There's also a bunch of Easter eggs and codes, to make the game a bit more interesting.

Have fun!
